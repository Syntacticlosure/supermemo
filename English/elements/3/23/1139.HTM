<SPAN class=extract>Winter holiday is coming, many students are looking forward to a wonderful long vacation so that they are busy making a vacation plan.</SPAN> <SPAN class=extract>According to a survey, students who go traveling and do social practices during vacations increase greatly while those who stay at home decrease a lot.<BR></SPAN>&#12288;&#12288;<SPAN class=extract>There are many reasons account for that</SPAN>. Firstly, with the fast development of economy, many people have become rich, which makes it possible for more students to go traveling. <SPAN class=extract>Also, modern transportation has made it easier for students to go out to travel.</SPAN> <SPAN class=extract>Secondly, the authorities of Chinese university have been encouraging their students to do social practices in the hope that college students would broaden their view to know more about the society and become more adaptable to the future work after they graduate.<BR></SPAN>&#12288;&#12288;In my opinion, <SPAN class=extract>it&#8217;s good to let more students go out traveling or doing social practices during the vacations for they have become much mature to realize how to spend our vacations meaningfully and practically.</SPAN>
