Selfish and Greedy<BR>&#12288;&#12288;There is no doubt that some people are selfish and greedy. <SPAN class=extract>For example,some merchants sell their fake commodities at the market place for more profit.</SPAN> They are rich and want to be richer. There are also government officials who sell people's trust. <SPAN class=extract>Senior officials who take bribes by selling the power in their hands are not a few.</SPAN> Those people believe in the precept "Everyone for himself and the devil take the hind most."<BR>&#12288;&#12288;<SPAN class=extract>However, the majority of people are neither selfish nor greedy.</SPAN> They contribute much and ask for little. <SPAN class=extract>Countless examples can be found around us, the PLA soldiers who sacrificed themselves for saving people's lives in fighting the disastrous floods and the warriors in white who risked their lives to save SARS victims being two of the most typical contrast to the selfish and corrupt official they are heroes, who set up glorious images for us.</SPAN><BR>&#12288;&#12288;<SPAN class=extract>The idea that nowadays people are selfish and greedy is probably attributed to the influence of the mass media which tend to over exaggerate the negative aspects of life.</SPAN> <SPAN class=extract>Many newspapers, particularly many local evening papers, and TV films play up nastiness by reporting and showing too much about violence and sex.</SPAN> <SPAN class=extract>A lot of books, too, portray selfishness and greed to seek sensational effect and economic profit. </SPAN>I wonder whether they are selfish and greedy, too?
