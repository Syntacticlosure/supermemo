<SPAN class=extract>In Thornton Wilder's 1938 play<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><EM>Our Town,<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN></EM>people gather to enjoy the beloved<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><STRONG>scent</STRONG><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>of heliotrope flowers in the moonlight.</SPAN> 
<P></P>
<P>The<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><STRONG>scene</STRONG><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>is memorable. At the time, the wonderfully light, but deeply sweet smell of heliotrope could be found in most American gardens.</P>
<P>Today, however, these flowering plants are rarely seen, or smelled, in the United States. <SPAN class=extract>Americans stopped growing heliotrope and other Victorian period flowers.</SPAN><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><STRONG>Hybrids</STRONG><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>and small, dense bedding plants are the substitutes in many gardens.Gardening expert Jessica Damiano writes for the Associated Press. She regrets the disappearance of these once common plants. In a recent report, she writes that gardeners should consider planting Victorian garden flowers.</P>
<P><STRONG>Four o'clocks (Mirabilis japala, Mirabilis multiflora)</STRONG></P>
<P>Damiano suggests four o'clocks as one candidate. These white, red, pink, purple, or yellow, flowers are shaped like trumpet musical instruments. <SPAN class=extract>Their<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><STRONG>petals</STRONG><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>open daily in late afternoon.</SPAN> They appear from spring until frost - the time when ice starts to form overnight.</P>
<P>The plant for these flowers does not require much care or water. It renews easily and gives out a sweet, lemony scent that brings bees, butterflies and hummingbirds to the plant to feed.</P>
<P><STRONG>Cosmos (Cosmos bipinnatus)</STRONG></P>
<P>The daisy-like cosmos grows from early summer through frost. Some even grow year-round in warmer climates. All of them self-seed, ensuring the flowers grow for years to come.</P>
<P><SPAN class=extract>The plant should grow in full sun, except for in southernmost areas, where they can use some<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><STRONG>shade</STRONG>.</SPAN> <SPAN class=extract>The flowers are colored in yellow, pink, orange, red, purple, white and maroon.</SPAN></P>
<P><STRONG>Sweet peas (Lathyrus odoratus)</STRONG></P>
<P><SPAN class=extract>Pink, purple, red, white or mixed color, the<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><STRONG>vine</STRONG><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>plant sweet peas blooms yearly during spring and early summer.</SPAN> The flower carries the scent of grapes in full sun in northern zones. In the south, it requires some afternoon shade.</P>
<P><STRONG>Kiss me over the garden gate (Persicaria orientalis)</STRONG></P>
<P>Kiss me over the garden gate was a favorite flower of America's third president, Thomas Jefferson.</P>
<P>This easy-care plant grows to nearly 2 meters tall making it perfect for the back of the garden. <SPAN class=extract>Its pink flowers hang from the plant in big<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><STRONG>bunches</STRONG>.</SPAN> In areas with cold winters, plant the seeds directly into the garden in autumn; in warm climates, keep them very cold for a week before planting outside.</P>
<P><STRONG>Hollyhocks (Alcea rosea)</STRONG></P>
<P><SPAN class=extract>Pink, purple, peach, red, white, yellow or near-black, hollyhock flowers will cover the plant's 2.5 meter tall<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><STRONG>stalks</STRONG><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>from top to bottom.</SPAN> <SPAN class=extract>The large-leaved plants are biennial, which means they live for two years and bloom only in their second year.</SPAN> But they do self-seed, so there will always be more flowers to come.</P>
<P>Plant them in full sun in the north and part shade in hot climates and provide a fence or similar structure for support.</P>
<P><STRONG>English primroses (Primula vulgaris)</STRONG></P>
<P>There are nearly 500 kinds of primroses in many colors. But most gardens likely include the yellow-flowered ones. The short-lived flowers that return yearly prefer partly wet, partly shady conditions. Grow them in winter in the south and the spring elsewhere.</P>
<P><STRONG>Soapwort (Saponaria)</STRONG></P>
<P><SPAN class=extract>Soapwort is a flowering herb.</SPAN> The groundcover blooms in late-spring and summer. It returns every year and can grow as high as one meter. Plant seeds directly into the garden in a sunny spot in spring. Remove dead flowers to avoid overgrowth.</P>
<P>You can make a liquid cleanser from soapwort. Cut up about 130 grams of the plant's leaves and<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><STRONG>stems</STRONG>. <SPAN class=extract>Place them in around 500 milliliters of boiling water.</SPAN> Bring down the heat to a low setting and cook for 15 minutes. Then, cool the liquid and use.</P>
<P><STRONG>Heliotropes (Heliotropium arborescens)</STRONG></P>
<P>With a wonderful, strong scent of cherry, almond and vanilla, heliotropes are grown yearly and available in several colors. The dark purple color flower was noted in the famous Thornton Wilder play.</P>
<P>Plant them in full sun everywhere except the deep South. There, the flowers will do best if provided some afternoon shade.</P>
