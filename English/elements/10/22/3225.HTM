<SPAN class=extract>Drug companies are testing new methods to improve the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines, using combination shots or<STRONG><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>nasal</STRONG><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>drops.</SPAN> They hope the continued research will help strengthen resistance to a continuously changing coronavirus. 
<P></P>
<P><STRONG>Original vaccines and "bivalent" vaccines</STRONG></P>
<P>The first COVID-19 vaccines remain protective against serious sickness, hospitalization and death, especially after a booster dose.</P>
<P><SPAN class=extract>However, drug companies are facing growing pressure to develop vaccines better at fighting off milder infections.</SPAN></P>
<P>Updating vaccines to match the latest<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><STRONG>variants</STRONG><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>is risky, because future variants could be very different. So, companies are considering something like a flu vaccine, which offers protection against three or four different strains in one shot every year.</P>
<P>Moderna and Pfizer are testing 2-in-1 COVID-19 protection that they hope to offer this fall. Each "bivalent" shot would mix the original, proven vaccine with an omicron-targeted version.</P>
<P>Moderna<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><A class=wsw__a href="https://apnews.com/article/covid-science-business-health-82d673c5cfd213e089c24e2e2eb90d20" rel="noreferrer noopener" target=_blank>has<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN></A>some early evidence that the idea could work. It tested a combination shot that targeted the original version of the virus and an earlier variant named beta. <SPAN class=extract>It found vaccine recipients developed limited levels of<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><STRONG>antibodies</STRONG><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>capable of fighting not just beta but also newer variants like omicron.</SPAN> Moderna now is testing its omicron-targeted bivalent candidate.</P>
<P><STRONG>Boosters</STRONG></P>
<P>Dr. David Kimberlin, a CDC adviser from the University of Alabama at Birmingham, recently suggested that for the average person, two doses of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine plus one booster &#8212; a total of three shots &#8212; "gets you set up" and ready for what may become a yearly booster.</P>
<P>After that first booster, CDC data suggests an additional dose offers most people a small, temporary<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><STRONG>benefit</STRONG>.</P>
<P>Experts recommend three shots because vaccination triggers development of antibodies that can fight off coronavirus infection. Such antibody levels naturally decrease over time.</P>
<P><SPAN class=extract>But memory cells jump into action to make new virus-fighters if an infection sneaks in.</SPAN> Rockefeller University researchers found those memory cells may become stronger and able to target more diverse kinds of the virus after the third shot.</P>
<P>Even if someone who is vaccinated gets a mild infection, memory cells still help give "time to protect you against severe illness," said Dr. Paul Offit of the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.</P>
<P>But some people &#8212; those with severely weakened immune systems &#8212; need more doses early on for a better chance of protection.</P>
<P>Americans 50 and older are being offered a second booster, following similar decisions by Israel and other countries that offer the extra shot to give older people a little more protection.</P>
<P><SPAN class=extract>The CDC is developing advice to help those<STRONG><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>eligible<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN></STRONG>decide whether to get an extra shot now or wait.</SPAN> Among those who might want a second booster sooner are the elderly, people with health problems or people who are at high risk of exposure from work or travel.</P>
<P><STRONG>Nasal vaccines</STRONG></P>
<P><SPAN class=extract>It is hard for a shot in the arm to form lots of virus-fighting antibodies inside the nose where the coronavirus latches on.</SPAN> But a nasal vaccine might offer a new way to prevent infections.</P>
<P>"When I think about what would make me get a second booster, I actually would want to prevent infection," <SPAN class=extract>said Dr. Grace Lee of Stanford University, who chairs CDC's immunization advisory committee.</SPAN> "I think we need to do better."</P>
<P>Nasal vaccines are difficult to develop, and it is not clear how quickly any could become available. But several are in clinical trials around the world. One in late-stage testing, made by India's Bharat Biotech, uses a chimpanzee cold virus to deliver a harmless copy of the coronavirus spike protein to the lining of the nose.</P>
<P>"I certainly do not want to abandon the success we have had" with COVID-19 shots, said Dr. Michael Diamond of Washington University in St. Louis. Diamond helped create the candidate that is now licensed to Bharat.</P>
<P>But "we're going to have a difficult time stopping transmission with the current ... vaccines," Diamond added. "We have all learned that."</P>
