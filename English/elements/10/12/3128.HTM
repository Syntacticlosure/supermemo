<P>This program takes a deeper look at words and expressions in the English language. Sometimes we take one word and see where it leads us.</P>
<P>Today, we look at the word "fence."</P>

<P>One definition of "fence" is an outdoor structure that encloses an area. Fences mark property. They are barriers. A fence is different from a wall because it does not have a solid foundation along its whole length.</P>
<P>Fences are used to keep things in -- like animals -- or keep things out -- like<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><STRONG>criminals</STRONG>.</P>
<P>Speaking of criminals, when they deal in stolen goods they are fencing and could be called a fence. And if the criminals are fencing stolen goods while having a sword fight, you say they are<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><STRONG>fencing</STRONG><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>fences.</P>
<P>But let's get back to "fence" meaning an outdoor structure.</P>
<P>As we said, a fence marks a property line. It gives you<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><STRONG>privacy</STRONG>. People can't see onto your property and<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><STRONG>vice versa</STRONG>. To many people, this is a good way to keep peace in a neighborhood. Everybody just minds their own business. Sometimes if a neighbor knows too much of your business, it could lead to problems.</P>
<P>That is where this<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><STRONG>proverb<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN></STRONG>comes from: "Fences make good neighbors." This proverb appears several times in Robert Frost's poem<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><EM>Mending Wall<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN></EM>published in 1914.</P>
<P>Our next expression is very common: To be on the fence.</P>
<P>If you are sitting "on the fence" about something you are undecided. A fence divides property into sides. So, if you are on the fence about something, you have not taken sides.</P>
<P>For example, let's say your child's school just raised $20,000. School officials want to spend that money on either new science equipment or a new outdoor play area. They ask the parents to give their opinion. <SPAN class=extract>But you don't know which is more important for the students. So, you sit on the fence for awhile. You don't feel strongly about either choice.</SPAN> If you did, you would certainly pick a side and not stay on the fence.</P>
<P>Sometimes we turn this saying into a noun.</P>
<P><SPAN class=extract>A "fence-sitter" is someone who always stays<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><STRONG>neutral</STRONG>.</SPAN><STRONG><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN></STRONG>They never take sides in an argument. They do not seem to have an opinion of their own. <SPAN class=extract>And they never take a<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><STRONG>stance<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN></STRONG>for anything.</SPAN> This could show a lack of<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><STRONG>courage</STRONG>. <SPAN class=extract>So, calling someone a fence-sitter is usually an insult.</SPAN></P>
<P>Now, that is not the case if you are simply undecided about an issue; or if you need more time to make a decision; or if you just don't care.</P>
<P>For example, let's say there is an election coming, and I have not decided who I am voting for. I can say, "I don't know. I'm on the fence between two candidates." This doesn't mean I'm unwilling or unable to pick a candidate. I just haven't yet.</P>
<P>However, let's say I never vote because I can't make a decision. <SPAN class=extract>And I have a long history of being indecisive.</SPAN> <SPAN class=extract>Someone could rightfully call me a fence-sitter. And that would rightfully be an insult.</SPAN></P>
