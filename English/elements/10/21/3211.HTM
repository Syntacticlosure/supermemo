Ngoc Anh of Vietnam knows the value of trees. 
<P></P>
<P><SPAN class=extract>For years, he worked as a<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><STRONG>logger</STRONG>.</SPAN> <SPAN class=extract>He cut trees down illegally to sell as<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><STRONG>timber.</STRONG></SPAN><STRONG><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN></STRONG>He often worked with others to carry 100-kilogram logs out of a quickly thinning forest.</P>
<P>But very high rainfall and floods increasingly damaged his community in the central province of Quang Binh. The 36-year-old Ngoc started reading about the climate and nature crises. <SPAN class=extract>He changed his work and became involved in tourism and environmental<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><STRONG>conservation</STRONG>.</SPAN></P>

<P>Now, Ngoc Anh is one of 250 former loggers to receive training from a tourism company. He works as a travel guide. He mostly leads foreign tourists through forests and into some of the world's largest caves in the Phong Nha-Ke Bang National Park.</P>
<P>"Before, whenever I saw a large tree, my head<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><STRONG>calculated</STRONG><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>how tall the tree was and how to cut it into logs of different sizes." Ngoc Anh said, "But now that I'm in the tourism business, when I see such a tree, I tell the tour group how valuable this tree is because there aren't many left."</P>
<P>Global Forest Watch estimates that Vietnam lost about 3 million hectares of tree cover between 2001 and 2020. That is a 20 percent decrease in 20 years. The losses were mostly driven by logging.</P>
<P><SPAN class=extract>In 2007, the government started taking more measures to prevent illegal logging, which has helped slow the rate of deforestation.</SPAN> Vietnam has also joined an international promise to end deforestation by 2030.</P>
<P><SPAN class=extract>Joined by a park official, Ngoc Anh and other tour guides help guard the trails to keep<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><STRONG>poachers</STRONG><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>away.</SPAN> They remove animal traps and clean up any waste.</P>
<P>Ngoc works for less than half the money of what he earned as a logger. But he hopes to earn more as tourism and travel return to Vietnam.</P>
