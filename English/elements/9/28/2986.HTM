Scientists have recently observed a large planet at an early stage of formation. The planet is already nine times the mass of Jupiter. 
<P></P>
<P>The researchers used the Subaru Telescope in Hawaii and the Hubble Space Telescope to find and study the planet. <SPAN class=extract>It is a gas giant orbiting an unusually far away young star.</SPAN> <SPAN class=extract>Gas giants are planets, like our solar system's Jupiter and Saturn.</SPAN> <SPAN class=extract>They are made up of hydrogen and helium.</SPAN> <SPAN class=extract>Those gases surround a smaller solid core, the innermost part of a planet.</SPAN>"</P>
<P><SPAN class=extract>We think it is still very early on in its 'birthing' process," said astrophysicist Thayne Currie of the Subaru Telescope and the NASA-Ames Research Center.</SPAN> He is the lead writer of the study that appeared recently in the publication Nature Astronomy. "Evidence suggests that this is the earliest stage of formation ever observed for a gas giant," he added.</P>

<P>The planet surrounds a star called AB Aurigae, about 9.5 trillion kilometers from Earth. An image of the star appeared in the 2021 film "Don't Look Up."</P>
<P><SPAN class=extract>About 5,000 planets beyond our solar system, or exoplanets, have been identified.</SPAN> This one, called AB Aur b, is among the largest.</P>
<P><SPAN class=extract>Planets in the process of formation - called protoplanets - have been observed around only one other star.</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN class=extract>Almost all known exoplanets have orbits around their stars within the distance that separates our sun and its most faraway planet, Neptune. </SPAN>But this planet orbits three times as far as Neptune from the sun and 93 times Earth's distance from the sun.</P>
<P>Its formation appears to be following a different process than the way planets usually form.</P>
<P>Olivier Guyon is an astronomer with the Subaru Telescope and the University of Arizona. He is a co-writer of the planet study. Guyon said the usual thinking is that most planets form by the slow growth of solids onto a rocky core. <SPAN class=extract>He noted that gas giants go through this process before the solid core is large enough to start<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><STRONG>layering</STRONG><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>gases.</SPAN></P>
<P>In this situation, protoplanets in the area surrounding a young star slowly grow out of dust- to large rock-sized solid objects. If this core reaches several times Earth's mass, they begin gathering gas from the surrounding dust and gas.</P>
<P>"This process cannot form giant planets at large orbital distance, so this discovery<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><STRONG>challenges</STRONG><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>our understanding of planet formation," Guyon said.</P>
<P>The researchers believe AB Aur b is forming in a situation in which the area around the star cools. Gravity then causes it to break up into one or more huge masses that form into planets.</P>
<P>The star AB Aurigae is about 2.4 times bigger than our sun and almost 60 times brighter. It is about 2 million years old -- very young compared to our 4.5-billion-year-old sun.</P>
<P>"New astronomical observations continuously challenge our current theories, ultimately improving our understanding of the universe," Guyon said.</P>
<P><SPAN class=extract>He added, "Planet formation is very complex and<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><STRONG>messy</STRONG>, with many surprises still ahead."</SPAN></P>
