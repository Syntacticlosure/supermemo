<P>in which J and J1, . . . , Jk are all judgements of the form being defined. The<BR>judgements above the horizontal line are called the <SPAN class=clozed>premises</SPAN> of the rule,<BR>and the judgement below the line is called its conclusion. If a rule has no<BR>premises (that is, when k is zero), the rule is called an <SPAN class=clozed>axiom</SPAN>; otherwise it is<BR>called <SPAN class=clozed>a proper rule</SPAN>.
